Objectives: To determine the effect of daily cinnamon spice supplementation in an amount commonly used for seasoning on glucose concentrations in adults with obesity and prediabetes.Methods: Following a 2-wk run-in period of maintaining a low polyphenol/fiber diet, 18 participants with obesity and prediabetes underwent a 10-wk randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover trial (mean age 51.1 y; mean fasting plasma glucose 102.9~mg/dL). The participants were randomly assigned to take cinnamon (4~g/d) or placebo for 4-wk, followed by a 2-wk washout period, and then crossed over to the other intervention for an additional 4-wk. Glucose changes were measured with continuous glucose monitoring. Oral glucose tolerance testing immediately following ingestion of cinnamon or placebo was performed at 4-time points to assess their acute effects both at the baseline and end of each intervention phase. Digestive symptom logs were obtained daily.', '# Effect of cinnamon spice on continuously monitored glycemic response in adults with prediabetes: a 4-week randomized controlled crossover trial\\n\\n## ABSTRACT\\n\\nResults: There were 694 follow-up days with 66,624 glucose observations. When compared with placebo, 24-h glucose concentrations were significantly lower when cinnamon was administered [mixed-models; effect size (ES)=0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI): -2.9, -1.5; P<0.0017. Similarly, the mean net-area-under-the-curve (netAUC) for glucose was significantly lower than for placebo when cinnamon was given (over 24 h; ES=-0.66:95\\\\% CI: 2501.7, 5412.1, P=0.01). Cinnamon supplementation resulted in lower glucose peaks compared with placebo (Apeak 9.56\\\\pm9.1~mg/dI compared with 11.73\\\\pm8.0~mg/dL; ES = -0.57; 95% CI: 0.8, 3.7, P=0.027). Glucose-dependent-insulinotropic-polypeptide concentrations increased during oral glucose tolerance testing + cinnamon testing (mixed-models; ES = 0.51; 95% CI: 1.56, 100.1, P=0.04, whereas triglyceride concentrations decreased (mixed-models; ES=0.55; 95% CI: -16.0, -1.6, P=0.02. Treatment adherence was excellent in both groups (cinnamon: 97.6\\\\pm3.4\\\\% compared with placebo: 97.9+3.7\\\\%; ES=-0.15; 95% CI: -1.8, 0.2, P=0.5. No differences were found in digestive symptoms (abdominal pain, borborygmi, bloating, excess flatus, and stools/day) between cinnamon and placebo groups.Conclusions: Cinnamon, a widely available and low-cost supplement, may contribute to better glucose control when added to the diet in people who have obesity-related prediabetes.', '# Effect of cinnamon spice on continuously monitored glycemic response in adults with prediabetes: a 4-week randomized controlled crossover trial\\n\\n## ABSTRACT\\n\\nThis trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04342624.Keywords: cinnamon, continuous glucose system, glycemic response, polyphenols, prediabetes']\n"

            "\n",
            "Cinnamon has shown promise as a natural supplement for managing prediabetes, but understanding its interactions with other dietary and lifestyle interventions is crucial for optimizing its effectiveness and safety. Here's a breakdown of potential interactions:\n",
            "\n",
            "**Dietary Interventions:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Fiber-rich foods:** Combining cinnamon with high-fiber foods like fruits, vegetables, and legumes can enhance its blood sugar-lowering effects. Fiber slows down the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates, leading to a more gradual rise in blood sugar levels.\n",
            "* **Low-glycemic index (GI) foods:** Pairing cinnamon with low-GI foods like whole grains, non-starchy vegetables, and lean protein can further improve blood sugar control. These foods cause a slower and smaller rise in blood sugar compared to high-GI foods.\n",
            "* **Mediterranean diet:** Studies suggest that incorporating cinnamon into a Mediterranean diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats, can provide synergistic benefits for managing prediabetes and reducing cardiovascular risk.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Lifestyle Interventions:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Physical activity:** Engaging in regular physical activity, like brisk walking, swimming, or cycling, can significantly improve insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control. Combining cinnamon with exercise can amplify these benefits, leading to better overall prediabetes management.\n",
            "* **Stress management:** Chronic stress can negatively impact blood sugar control. Techniques like yoga, meditation, and deep breathing can help manage stress and potentially enhance the effectiveness of cinnamon in managing prediabetes.\n",
            "* **Weight management:** Losing even a small amount of weight can significantly improve blood sugar control and reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Combining cinnamon with a healthy weight-loss program can maximize these benefits.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Potential Interactions with Medications:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Blood sugar-lowering medications:** It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional before using cinnamon with blood sugar-lowering medications, as it might increase the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Dosage adjustments may be necessary to avoid potential interactions.\n",
            "* **Blood-thinning medications:** Cinnamon may interact with blood-thinning medications like warfarin, increasing the risk of bleeding. Consult a healthcare professional before combining them.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Important Considerations:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Cinnamon type:** Ceylon cinnamon is generally considered safer than Cassia cinnamon, which contains higher levels of coumarin, a compound that can be harmful in large amounts.\n",
            "* **Dosage:** While studies suggest 1-6 grams of cinnamon daily can be beneficial, individual needs may vary. Consult a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate dosage for your specific situation.\n",
            "* **Safety:** Cinnamon is generally safe for most people, but some individuals may experience mild side effects like heartburn or allergic reactions.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Conclusion:**\n",
            "\n",
            "Cinnamon can be a valuable addition to a comprehensive prediabetes management plan, but it's essential to understand its interactions with other dietary and lifestyle interventions. Consulting a healthcare professional can help you create a personalized approach that optimizes the benefits of cinnamon while minimizing potential risks. \n",
            "\n",
            "Remember, cinnamon is not a magic bullet and should be used in conjunction with other evidence-based interventions like healthy eating, regular exercise, and stress management. By working with your healthcare provider, you can develop a safe and effective strategy for managing prediabetes and improving your overall health.\n"
